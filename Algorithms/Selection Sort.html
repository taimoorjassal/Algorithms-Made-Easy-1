        <p class="description">
          Selection sort is noted for its simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations.

          The animation of Selection Sort algorithm shows unsorted bars at first. When the algorithm is started it selects one element and then compares it with the adjacent one. The bigger one is then compared with the adjacent one. This is repeated until we reach to the last element of the data. This way the largest element is placed in the right. Then algorithm keeps repeating until whole of the data is sorted in this way. In the end the data is arranged in an ascending order.
