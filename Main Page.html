            <p id="description"> Algorithms made easy helps the user who face difficulties in understanding the working of the algorithms.
                It can become complex to understand a few steps which solves many problems. It is also very important to
                know how algorithms work so that they are used in the right circumstances. To get to know the algorithm deeply,
                we have created a program which would help you understand a few set of algorithms.</p>
